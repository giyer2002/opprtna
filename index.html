        <h2>About Opprtna Therapeutics</h2>
        <p>Opprtna Therapeutics is a biotechnology company focused on developing aptamer-based therapies for a wide range of diseases. Our mission is to leverage the power of aptamers to deliver novel, safe, and effective treatments to patients.</p>
        <p>Aptamers are synthetic single-stranded DNA or RNA molecules that bind to specific targets with high affinity and selectivity. This makes them ideal candidates for developing targeted therapies that can modulate disease pathways with minimal side effects.</p>
        <p>Our team of experienced scientists is committed to pushing the boundaries of aptamer technology to develop innovative therapies that address unmet medical needs.</p>
